Difficulty Levels
================

The MVT Nexus question database implements a three-tier difficulty system that provides clear differentiation between question complexity levels. This system enables adaptive testing and precise difficulty calibration across all knowledge categories.

Difficulty Scale
--------------

Level 0 - Basic
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Characteristics:
    * Fundamental knowledge questions
    * Common facts and basic concepts
    * Clear, straightforward wording
    * Generally well-known information
    * Simple recall requirements

Examples:
    * "What is the capital of France?" (Geography)
    * "What is 2 + 2?" (Mathematics)
    * "What color is a banana?" (General Knowledge)
    * "What is the chemical symbol for water?" (Science)

Level 1 - Intermediate
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Characteristics:
    * More detailed knowledge required
    * Multiple concept understanding
    * Some analysis needed
    * Less commonly known information
    * Application of basic principles

Examples:
    * "Who wrote 'Romeo and Juliet'?" (Literature)
    * "What is the square root of 64?" (Mathematics)
    * "What is the atomic number of carbon?" (Science)
    * "Which planet is known as the Red Planet?" (Astronomy)

Level 2 - Advanced
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Characteristics:
    * Complex concept integration
    * Detailed specific knowledge
    * Higher-order thinking required
    * Specialized information
    * Multiple step reasoning

Examples:
    * "What is the largest known prime number (as of 2023)?" (Mathematics)
    * "What is the Goldbach Conjecture?" (Mathematics)
    * "Who proposed the heliocentric model of the solar system?" (Astronomy)
    * "What is the half-life of carbon-14?" (Science)

Difficulty Distribution
--------------------
The database maintains a balanced distribution of difficulty levels:

.. code-block:: text

    Level 0 (Basic): ~40% of questions
    Level 1 (Intermediate): ~35% of questions
    Level 2 (Advanced): ~25% of questions

This distribution ensures:
    * Adequate coverage at all difficulty levels
    * Progressive complexity increase
    * Suitable challenge range
    * Effective differentiation capability

Application Across Categories
--------------------------
Difficulty levels are consistently applied across all knowledge categories:

1. Geography
    * Level 0: Basic capital cities
    * Level 1: Country characteristics
    * Level 2: Complex geographical phenomena

2. Mathematics
    * Level 0: Basic arithmetic
    * Level 1: Algebra and geometry
    * Level 2: Advanced mathematical concepts

3. Science
    * Level 0: Basic scientific facts
    * Level 1: Scientific principles
    * Level 2: Complex scientific theories

4. Literature
    * Level 0: Famous authors and works
    * Level 1: Literary analysis
    * Level 2: Complex literary concepts

Usage in Assessment
-----------------
The difficulty system supports:

1. Adaptive Testing
    * Dynamic difficulty adjustment
    * Performance-based progression
    * Personalized assessment paths

2. Knowledge Evaluation
    * Precise skill level determination
    * Progress tracking
    * Learning gap identification

3. Research Applications
    * Controlled difficulty variables
    * Comparative analysis
    * Performance metrics

Implementation Guidelines
----------------------
When working with difficulty levels:

1. Consider the target audience
2. Account for category-specific complexity
3. Use progressive difficulty increases
4. Maintain consistent standards
5. Regular calibration and validation

Quality Assurance
---------------
Difficulty levels undergo regular review:

* Expert validation of assignments
* Statistical analysis of response patterns
* User feedback integration
* Cross-category consistency checks
* Regular calibration updates
